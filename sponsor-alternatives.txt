Here're some alternatives to YouTube sponsor shit. I'm only listing worst offenders that have clearly superior alternatives directly.

--- Beginning paragraph ---

Here are some alternatives to the sponsored products that I have deemed to have directly superior alternatives. (Taken from https://nathaniel.fitzenrider.com/sponsor-alternatives.txt):

--- Password Manager ---

KeePassXC (https://www.keepassxc.org) is a completely free (libre) password manager on unlimited devices. It stores passwords in a file, which means you can choose any Cloud solution you want. Since it's encrypted, you can use literally anything. Some Cloud solutions include Keybase (https://keybase.io), Google Drive, and OneDrive. It has secure passphrase and password generation and even secure password sharing with KeeShare. (I wouldn't share my passwords with anyone, but the option is there if you share a Netflix account or something.)

--- VPN ---

An alternative to a VPN is just not using one. More than 70% of Web traffic is encrypted with mIlItARy gRaDe eNcRypTioN (HTTPS), which kills more than 99.99% of coffee shop hackers guaranteed. Most sites worth their salt use HTTPS (the padlock icon at the top). People can only see what sites you're visiting (from IP, DNS, etc.), and not the data sent with a standard Web browser. If you really want to hide what sites you're visiting you can just use Tor (https://www.torproject.org/). Tor is a better alternative to a VPN for many reasons, one of them being that it's free (libre). Here's a comprehensive list of them: https://matt.traudt.xyz/p/24tFBCJV.html (taken from https://redd.it/do9fiy).

--- Any video game (joke) ---

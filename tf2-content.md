# My Custom TF2 Content

So I created a few TF2 scripts... they're a bit buggy but they still work. You can download it here:

[Download](//github.com/nfitzen/tf2-content/releases/latest){:target="_blank"}

I have a custom 7zSD.sfx for installing to your TF2 custom directory. This is what I use:

[Custom SFX Module](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OlegScherbakov/7zSFX/master/files/7zsd_extra_162_3888.7z){:target="_blank"}

(I use the 7zsd_All.sfx)

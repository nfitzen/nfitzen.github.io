# Nathaniel / NateROCKS112 / nfitzen's Website

Net neutrality is \*not\* dead yet, so please help! [Here's some tips to convince others!](netneutrality)
{: #nn}

Hello,

I am nfitzen, as well as NateROCKS112 on many of my used web services.

Here are some things that I've done for fun:

[My Minecraft media and misc. things \(in case you're interested\)](mc-content/)

[My TF2 content \(in case you're interested\)](tf2-content)

[I prefer having my tweets about YouTube videos slightly better so here's a tweak](like-tweet-generator/)

[I made a command for Nightbot. (More coming soon:tm:)](/nightbot-custom-commands)

For verification purposes, my Keybase profile:

[Keybase/nfitzen](//keybase.io/nfitzen){:target="_blank"}

[Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@nfitzen){:rel="me" target="_blank"}

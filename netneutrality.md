# Net Neutrality

The FCC has voted to kill net neutrality. What does that mean for you, and how can you take action?
- Keep in mind that this is NOT a partisan issue. It is almost every U.S. citizen versus a few greedy corporations.

For starters, watch this video for a short and sweet explanation:

1. Your local internet provider can block your favorite websites.
	- This means that your freedom of information is now in the hands of big business.
2. In order to get access to websites like Netflix, you may have to pay extra money on top of your current internet bill.
3. Anybody who argues that the repeal fosters competition, does not take into account that ISPs are in an oligopoly.
	- basically a monopoly, but in certain areas, so it's legal. If **Google** themselves couldn't succeed in the cable market (Google Fiber), who can?
        - Note that people say that was _because_ of net neutrality. Google Fiber existed since 2010 and ologopolies were half the reason, before net neutrality was codified.
4. If you trust your ISPs to not do this, just look in the past. ISPs have already _done_ this.
5. If Netflix had to pay millions before 2015 to not get slowed down, what about smaller services? How will they pay to keep up with their customers?
6. If Netflix has to pay to stay in the "fast-lane", then who will be keeping up those extra, unnecessary costs to access them? That's right. YOU.
7. Most people argue it would be the same as before 2015. However, the FCC has been making sure ISPs don't abuse their power since the dawn of the internet.
It was only codified into law in 2015. Trump's FCC has gone rogue, and chairman Ajit Pai is even being investigated for corruption _by his own branch of govt._

### If you don't want your ability to access the internet freely handed to ISPs on a silver platter, you can take action.

We only need **1** more vote to stop this repeal. (Look up the Congressional Review Act (CRA)).

It already passed the Senate, so it needs to go through the House now, which we need at least 25 Republican votes. Net Neutrality is NOT dead yet! Keep fighting!

Here are some tools to take action:

[Battle for the Net](https://www.battleforthenet.com) provides further reading, as well as easy ways to contact your local representatives. Recommended 

[Resistbot](https://resist.bot/) provides an easy way to contact representatives no matter the issue. I'd recommend both [BftN](https://www.battleforthenet.com) and [Resistbot](https://resist.bot).

Note: if you just want to use [Resistbot](https://resist.bot/) on the fly, just text [RESIST to 50409](sms:50409?body=RESIST) or use [Telegram](https://t.me/resistbot/) or [FB Messenger](https://www.messenger.com/t/resistbot)

The [Telegram](https://t.me/resistbot/) and [Messenger](https://www.messenger.com/t/resistbot) options are preferred as there are no SMS fees for [Resistbot](https://resist.bot/).

Note that the reason these need your address is because if Congress is not provided with the address of the constituent, the message is immediately marked as invalid.

**We, the people of the US, need _your_ help, whether some know or not, so please do whatever you can to save net neutrality, and therefore our internet freedoms.**
